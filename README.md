Hello World ICO example by Validity Labs.

## VSCode Plugin recommendations
We strongly recommend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following plugins, because it provides the best solidity development experience and ensures compliance with our coding styleguide and rules.

- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [JuanBlanco.solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)
- [vscode-todo-highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)

## Requirements
The server side scripts requires NodeJS 8.
Go to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the appropriate version for your system.

Yarn is required to be installed globally to minimize the risk of dependency issues.
Go to [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and choose the right installer for your system.

Depending on your system the following components might be already available or have to be provided manually:
* Python 2.7
* make (on Ubuntu this is part of the commonly installed `sudo apt-get install build-essential`)
* On OSX the build tools included in XCode are required

## General
Before running the provided scripts, you have to initialize your current terminal via `source ./initShell.sh` for every terminal in use. This will add the current directory to the system PATH variables and must be repeated for time you start a new terminal window from project base directory.
```
cd <project base directory>
source ./initShell.sh
```

__Every command must be executed from within the projects base directory!__

## Setup
Open your terminal and change into your project base directory. From here, install all needed dependencies.
```
cd <project base directory>
source ./initShell.sh
yarn install
```
This will install all required dependecies in the directory _node_modules_.

## Compile, migrate and run unit tests
To deploy the ICO smart contracts, go into the projects root directory, and change into the truffle development console.
```
cd <project base directory>
source ./initShell.sh
yarn run dev
```

Now you can compile, migrate and run tests.
```
# Compile contract
compile

# Migrate contract
migrate

# Test the contract
test
```
__The development console will automatically start it's own TestRPC server for you!__

__Because the tests may consumes a lot of ETH, please restart the development console between each test!__

## Run the coverage test
To run the coverage tests, go into the projects root directory and run the coverage test like that.
```
cd <project base directory>
source ./initShell.sh
yarn run coverage
```
__The coverage test will automatically start it's own TestRPC server for you!__
